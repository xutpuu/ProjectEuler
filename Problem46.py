# It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

# 9 = 7 + 2×1²
# 15 = 7 + 2×2²
# 21 = 3 + 2×3²
# 25 = 7 + 2×3²
# 27 = 19 + 2×2²
# 33 = 31 + 2×1²

# It turns out that the conjecture was false.

# What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
